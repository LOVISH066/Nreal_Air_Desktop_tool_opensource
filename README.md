# Fundraising:
Also, for people wanting something on the Steamdeck, I'd love to make a remote-desktop version that lets you connect in to your main PC but I'd either need to raise enough cash to buy this plugin as I don't have the time to develop such a system (About $250 usd) : Unity Asset Store
So if you'd like such a tool, I'll be collecting cash here: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/adampinto
